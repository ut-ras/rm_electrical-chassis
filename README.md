# Chassis board
![A 3D rendering of the chassis board](https://github.com/ut-ras/robomaster_hardware/assets/24881514/0db08e80-0acc-4a6b-abac-c93a3b0614a4)

This project contains the chassis board, which routes power and CAN to the wheels from the PMM and the Dev Board, respectively.  
Also, a buck converter that drives the 19V power needed for the CV board. This is sent up the slip ring.
